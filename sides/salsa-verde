Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pounds tomatillos, husks and stems removed
- 1 to 2 jalape√±o or serrano peppers, stem and seeds removed
- 1 small white onion, skin removed, split in half
- 1 bunch cilantro leaves and tender stems
- salt

Instructions
1. Combine tomatillos, serranos, and onion in a medium saucepan and cover with water. 
Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to a simmer. 
Simmer until vegetables are completely softened, about 10 minutes, 
stirring occasionally to make sure all sides are softened.

2. Drain vegetables then transfer to a blender. 
Add cilantro and a large pinch of salt. 
Blend on medium speed until a chunky puree is formed, about 30 seconds. 
Transfer to a bowl, season to taste with more salt or lime juice if necessary, and serve.
